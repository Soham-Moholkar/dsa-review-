# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

Width shrinks each step, so only moving the shorter boundary can possibly improve height.

## State or invariant to remember

Every discarded pair using the shorter boundary cannot beat a future pair with that same boundary.

## Optimal approach

**Two pointers with equal-height skip**

- Time: `O(n)`
- Extra space: `O(1)`

## Mental checklist

1. What information must be maintained while moving through the array?
2. Why is the brute-force method slower?
3. Which assumption makes the optimal movement valid?
4. Which boundary, duplicate, overflow, or empty-input case can break the code?
5. Can the solution be recoded without viewing `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?

## Memory trigger

```text
Pattern: Two Pointers
Maintain: Every discarded pair using the shorter boundary cannot beat a future pair with that same boundary.
```
