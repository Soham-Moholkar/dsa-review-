# GeeksforGeeks: Pair Sum in Sorted Array

## Problem summary

Determine whether a sorted array contains a pair whose sum equals the target.

This is a study summary, not a verbatim copy of the platform statement. Confirm the current platform signature and constraints before submission.

## Classification

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Platform | GeeksforGeeks |
| Problem number | — |
| Study difficulty | Easy |
| Main topic | Arrays / Vectors |
| Pattern | Two Pointers |

## Recognition cue

The input is sorted and the sum can be increased or decreased by moving an endpoint.

## Invariant

All discarded pairs are impossible based on the sorted order.

## Approach progression

| Level | Approach | Time | Extra space |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Original | Your untouched first attempt | Not assessed until added | Not assessed |
| Brute force | Compare every pair | O(n^2) | O(1) |
| Better | Hash set lookup | O(n) average | O(n) |
| Optimal | Opposite-end two pointers | O(n) | O(1) |
