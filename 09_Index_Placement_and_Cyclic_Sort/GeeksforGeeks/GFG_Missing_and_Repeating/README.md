# GeeksforGeeks: Missing and Repeating

## Problem summary

Return the repeating value and the missing value from numbers 1 through n.

This is a study summary, not a verbatim copy of the platform statement. Confirm the current platform signature and constraints before submission.

## Classification

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Platform | GeeksforGeeks |
| Problem number | — |
| Study difficulty | Medium |
| Main topic | Arrays / Vectors |
| Pattern | Index Placement and Cyclic Sort |

## Recognition cue

Every valid value maps to index value-1, allowing visitation marking.

## Invariant

A negative value at an index means its corresponding number has already appeared.

## Approach progression

| Level | Approach | Time | Extra space |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Original | Your untouched first attempt | Not assessed until added | Not assessed |
| Brute force | Count every possible value | O(n^2) | O(1) |
| Better | Frequency array | O(n) | O(n) |
| Optimal | Sign marking | O(n) | O(1) |
