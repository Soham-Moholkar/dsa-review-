# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

Use existence rather than original order, and start only at sequence beginnings.

## State or invariant to remember

Every sequence is counted exactly once from its smallest value.

## Optimal approach

**Hash set sequence starts**

- Time: `O(n) average`
- Extra space: `O(n)`

## Mental checklist

1. What information must be maintained while moving through the array?
2. Why is the brute-force method slower?
3. Which assumption makes the optimal movement valid?
4. Which boundary, duplicate, overflow, or empty-input case can break the code?
5. Can the solution be recoded without viewing `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?
