# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

Values lie in a known range, so array indexes can encode counts.

## State or invariant to remember

Positive cells hold unprocessed values; nonpositive cells hold consumed slots or negative occurrence counts.

## Optimal approach

**Consume values into negative counters**

- Time: `O(n)`
- Extra space: `O(1)`

## Mental checklist

1. What information must be maintained while moving through the array?
2. Why is the brute-force method slower?
3. Which assumption makes the optimal movement valid?
4. Which boundary, duplicate, overflow, or empty-input case can break the code?
5. Can the solution be recoded without viewing `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?

## Memory trigger

Pattern: Hashing and Frequency Counting
Maintain: Positive cells hold unprocessed values; nonpositive cells hold consumed slots or negative occurrence counts.
