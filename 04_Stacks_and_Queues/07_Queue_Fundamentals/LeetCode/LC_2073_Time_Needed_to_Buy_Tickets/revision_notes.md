# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

Model repeated fair turns without changing the identity of the target person.

## State or invariant to remember

One FIFO turn serves one ticket and preserves everybody else’s order.

## Optimal approach

**Fifo turns reference**

- Time: `O(n)`
- Extra space: `O(1)`

## Mental checklist

1. What state is updated when the next item arrives?
2. Which explicit comparison makes the baseline slower or use more storage?
3. Why does the invariant still hold after an item is processed or removed?
4. Which duplicate, empty, overflow, or boundary case breaks a careless solution?
5. Can you recode the answer without opening `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?

## Memory trigger
