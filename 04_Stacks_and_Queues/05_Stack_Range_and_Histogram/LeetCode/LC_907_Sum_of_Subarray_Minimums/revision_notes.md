# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

Count the ranges in which one element acts as a minimum and resolve duplicate ownership.

## State or invariant to remember

A subarray minimum is charged to one index using a consistent duplicate tie.

## Optimal approach

**Pse/nse reference**

- Time: `O(n)`
- Extra space: `O(n)`

## Mental checklist

1. What state is updated when the next item arrives?
2. Which explicit comparison makes the baseline slower or use more storage?
3. Why does the invariant still hold after an item is processed or removed?
4. Which duplicate, empty, overflow, or boundary case breaks a careless solution?
5. Can you recode the answer without opening `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?

## Memory trigger

```text
Pattern: Stack Range and Histogram
Maintain: A subarray minimum is charged to one index using a consistent duplicate tie.
```
