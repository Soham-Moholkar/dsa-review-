# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

Determine which pairs can interact while preserving surviving order.

## State or invariant to remember

Only opposing directions can collide; survivors keep their original order.

## Optimal approach

**Stack simulation reference**

- Time: `O(n)`
- Extra space: `O(n)`

## Mental checklist

1. What state is updated when the next item arrives?
2. Which explicit comparison makes the baseline slower or use more storage?
3. Why does the invariant still hold after an item is processed or removed?
4. Which duplicate, empty, overflow, or boundary case breaks a careless solution?
5. Can you recode the answer without opening `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?
