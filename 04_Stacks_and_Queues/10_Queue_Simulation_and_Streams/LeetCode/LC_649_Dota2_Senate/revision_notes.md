# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

Preserve turn order across repeated rounds of a process.

## State or invariant to remember

Each queue holds the next active turn for that party.

## Optimal approach

**Two fifo groups reference**

- Time: `O(n)`
- Extra space: `O(n)`

## Mental checklist

1. What state is updated when the next item arrives?
2. Which explicit comparison makes the baseline slower or use more storage?
3. Why does the invariant still hold after an item is processed or removed?
4. Which duplicate, empty, overflow, or boundary case breaks a careless solution?
5. Can you recode the answer without opening `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?

## Memory trigger

```text
Pattern: Queue Simulation and Streams
Maintain: Each queue holds the next active turn for that party.
```
