# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

Track the closest greater predecessor rather than a future element.

## State or invariant to remember

Candidates to the left are popped until the nearest greater value remains.

## Optimal approach

**Decreasing monotonic stack reference**

- Time: `O(n)`
- Extra space: `O(n)`

## Mental checklist

1. What state is updated when the next item arrives?
2. Which explicit comparison makes the baseline slower or use more storage?
3. Why does the invariant still hold after an item is processed or removed?
4. Which duplicate, empty, overflow, or boundary case breaks a careless solution?
5. Can you recode the answer without opening `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?

## Memory trigger

```text
Pattern: Monotonic Stack
Maintain: Candidates to the left are popped until the nearest greater value remains.
```
