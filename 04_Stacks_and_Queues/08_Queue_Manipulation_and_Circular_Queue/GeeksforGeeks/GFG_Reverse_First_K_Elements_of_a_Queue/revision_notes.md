# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

Keep the suffix in its original order while reversing only a prefix.

## State or invariant to remember

Only the first k elements change order; the suffix remains in order.

## Optimal approach

**Partial reversal reference**

- Time: `O(n)`
- Extra space: `O(n)`

## Mental checklist

1. What state is updated when the next item arrives?
2. Which explicit comparison makes the baseline slower or use more storage?
3. Why does the invariant still hold after an item is processed or removed?
4. Which duplicate, empty, overflow, or boundary case breaks a careless solution?
5. Can you recode the answer without opening `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?

## Memory trigger

```text
Pattern: Queue Manipulation and Circular Queue
Maintain: Only the first k elements change order; the suffix remains in order.
```
