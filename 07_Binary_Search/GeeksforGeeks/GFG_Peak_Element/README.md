# GeeksforGeeks: Peak Element

## Problem summary

Return an index whose value is not smaller than its neighbours.

This is a study summary, not a verbatim copy of the platform statement. Confirm the current platform signature and constraints before submission.

## Classification

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Platform | GeeksforGeeks |
| Problem number | — |
| Study difficulty | Medium |
| Main topic | Arrays / Vectors |
| Pattern | Binary Search |

## Recognition cue

The slope direction tells which half must contain a peak.

## Invariant

A peak always exists inside the retained interval.

## Approach progression

| Level | Approach | Time | Extra space |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Original | Your untouched first attempt | Not assessed until added | Not assessed |
| Brute force | Check every index and both neighbours | O(n) | O(1) |
| Better | Linear slope scan | O(n) | O(1) |
| Optimal | Binary search on slope | O(log n) | O(1) |
