# GeeksforGeeks: Search in Rotated Sorted Array

## Problem summary

Return the index of key in a rotated sorted array with distinct values.

This is a study summary, not a verbatim copy of the platform statement. Confirm the current platform signature and constraints before submission.

## Classification

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Platform | GeeksforGeeks |
| Problem number | — |
| Study difficulty | Medium |
| Main topic | Arrays / Vectors |
| Pattern | Binary Search |

## Recognition cue

At least one half around mid remains normally sorted.

## Invariant

After identifying the sorted half, discard the half that cannot contain key.

## Approach progression

| Level | Approach | Time | Extra space |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Original | Your untouched first attempt | Not assessed until added | Not assessed |
| Brute force | Linear search | O(n) | O(1) |
| Better | Find pivot, then ordinary binary search | O(log n) | O(1) |
| Optimal | Modified binary search | O(log n) | O(1) |
