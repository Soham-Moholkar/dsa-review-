# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

All indexes and values cancel under XOR except the missing value.

## State or invariant to remember

answer contains XOR of unmatched index/value information processed so far.

## Optimal approach

**XOR indexes and values**

- Time: `O(n)`
- Extra space: `O(1)`

## Mental checklist

1. What information must be maintained while moving through the array?
2. Why is the brute-force method slower?
3. Which assumption makes the optimal movement valid?
4. Which boundary, duplicate, overflow, or empty-input case can break the code?
5. Can the solution be recoded without viewing `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?

## Memory trigger

```text
Pattern: Index Placement and Cyclic Sort
Maintain: answer contains XOR of unmatched index/value information processed so far.
```
