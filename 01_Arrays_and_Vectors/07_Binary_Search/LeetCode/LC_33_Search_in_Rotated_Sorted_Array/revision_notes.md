# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

One side of mid is always sorted.

## State or invariant to remember

The retained side is the only side that can still contain target.

## Optimal approach

**One modified binary search**

- Time: `O(log n)`
- Extra space: `O(1)`

## Mental checklist

1. What information must be maintained while moving through the array?
2. Why is the brute-force method slower?
3. Which assumption makes the optimal movement valid?
4. Which boundary, duplicate, overflow, or empty-input case can break the code?
5. Can the solution be recoded without viewing `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?

## Memory trigger

```text
Pattern: Binary Search
Maintain: The retained side is the only side that can still contain target.
```
