# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

Find the rightmost ascent, swap with the smallest greater suffix value, then reverse the suffix.

## State or invariant to remember

The suffix after the pivot is non-increasing and can be reversed into its smallest order.

## Optimal approach

**Manual pivot, successor, and suffix reversal**

- Time: `O(n)`
- Extra space: `O(1)`

## Mental checklist

1. What information must be maintained while moving through the array?
2. Why is the brute-force method slower?
3. Which assumption makes the optimal movement valid?
4. Which boundary, duplicate, overflow, or empty-input case can break the code?
5. Can the solution be recoded without viewing `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?
