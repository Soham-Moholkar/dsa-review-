# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

Sort by start so overlapping ranges become adjacent.

## State or invariant to remember

Only the last merged interval can overlap the current sorted interval.

## Optimal approach

**One sorted pass**

- Time: `O(n log n)`
- Extra space: `O(n) answer`

## Mental checklist

1. What information must be maintained while moving through the array?
2. Why is the brute-force method slower?
3. Which assumption makes the optimal movement valid?
4. Which boundary, duplicate, overflow, or empty-input case can break the code?
5. Can the solution be recoded without viewing `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?
