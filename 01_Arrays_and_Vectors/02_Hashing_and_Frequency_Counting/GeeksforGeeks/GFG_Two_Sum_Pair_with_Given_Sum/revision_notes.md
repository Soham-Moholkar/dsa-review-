# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

The current value needs a complement that may already have appeared.

## State or invariant to remember

seen contains exactly the values processed before the current index.

## Optimal approach

**Hash-set complement lookup**

- Time: `O(n) average`
- Extra space: `O(n)`

## Mental checklist

1. What information must be maintained while moving through the array?
2. Why is the brute-force method slower?
3. Which assumption makes the optimal movement valid?
4. Which boundary, duplicate, overflow, or empty-input case can break the code?
5. Can the solution be recoded without viewing `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?
