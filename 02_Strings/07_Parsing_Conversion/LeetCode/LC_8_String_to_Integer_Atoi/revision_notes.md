# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

Process whitespace, optional sign, digits, and overflow in the exact required order.

## State or invariant to remember

Only an optional sign and the leading consecutive digits affect the value.

## Optimal approach

**Parsing states reference**

- Time: `O(n)`
- Extra space: `O(1)`

## Mental checklist

1. What state is updated when the next item arrives?
2. Which explicit comparison makes the baseline slower or use more storage?
3. Why does the invariant still hold after an item is processed or removed?
4. Which duplicate, empty, overflow, or boundary case breaks a careless solution?
5. Can you recode the answer without opening `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?

## Memory trigger

Pattern: Parsing Conversion
Maintain: Only an optional sign and the leading consecutive digits affect the value.
