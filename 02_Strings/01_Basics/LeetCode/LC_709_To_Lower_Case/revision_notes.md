# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

Learn to transform selected characters while leaving all other characters unchanged.

## State or invariant to remember

Every character before the current position has its required case.

## Optimal approach

**Character traversal reference**

- Time: `O(n)`
- Extra space: `O(1)`

## Mental checklist

1. What state is updated when the next item arrives?
2. Which explicit comparison makes the baseline slower or use more storage?
3. Why does the invariant still hold after an item is processed or removed?
4. Which duplicate, empty, overflow, or boundary case breaks a careless solution?
5. Can you recode the answer without opening `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?

## Memory trigger

```text
Pattern: Basics
Maintain: Every character before the current position has its required case.
```
