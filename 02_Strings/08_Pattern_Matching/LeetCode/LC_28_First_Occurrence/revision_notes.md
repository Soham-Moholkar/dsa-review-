# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

Start with direct alignment checking and make every boundary explicit before using advanced algorithms.

## State or invariant to remember

All candidate match positions before the current offset have been checked.

## Optimal approach

**Naive pattern matching reference**

- Time: `O(nm) worst case`
- Extra space: `O(1)`

## Mental checklist

1. What state is updated when the next item arrives?
2. Which explicit comparison makes the baseline slower or use more storage?
3. Why does the invariant still hold after an item is processed or removed?
4. Which duplicate, empty, overflow, or boundary case breaks a careless solution?
5. Can you recode the answer without opening `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?

## Memory trigger

```text
Pattern: Pattern Matching
Maintain: All candidate match positions before the current offset have been checked.
```
