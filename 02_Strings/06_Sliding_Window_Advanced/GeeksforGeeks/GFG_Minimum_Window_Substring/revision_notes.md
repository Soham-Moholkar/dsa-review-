# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

Track when all required counts are satisfied, then remove unnecessary characters from the left.

## State or invariant to remember

The missing count is zero exactly when the current window covers t.

## Optimal approach

**Variable window reference**

- Time: `O(n + m)`
- Extra space: `O(1)`

## Mental checklist

1. What state is updated when the next item arrives?
2. Which explicit comparison makes the baseline slower or use more storage?
3. Why does the invariant still hold after an item is processed or removed?
4. Which duplicate, empty, overflow, or boundary case breaks a careless solution?
5. Can you recode the answer without opening `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?

## Memory trigger

```text
Pattern: Sliding Window Advanced
Maintain: The missing count is zero exactly when the current window covers t.
```
