# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

Skip non-target characters from both ends and swap only members of the selected set.

## State or invariant to remember

Only vowel positions change; processed ends already contain the reversed vowels.

## Optimal approach

**Two pointers reference**

- Time: `O(n)`
- Extra space: `O(n)`

## Mental checklist

1. What state is updated when the next item arrives?
2. Which explicit comparison makes the baseline slower or use more storage?
3. Why does the invariant still hold after an item is processed or removed?
4. Which duplicate, empty, overflow, or boundary case breaks a careless solution?
5. Can you recode the answer without opening `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?

## Memory trigger

```text
Pattern: Two Pointers Palindrome
Maintain: Only vowel positions change; processed ends already contain the reversed vowels.
```
