# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

Learn why counting first and locating second can be clearer than mixing both jobs.

## State or invariant to remember

A frequency count represents every input character; the first count of one wins.

## Optimal approach

**Frequency table reference**

- Time: `O(n)`
- Extra space: `O(1)`

## Mental checklist

1. What state is updated when the next item arrives?
2. Which explicit comparison makes the baseline slower or use more storage?
3. Why does the invariant still hold after an item is processed or removed?
4. Which duplicate, empty, overflow, or boundary case breaks a careless solution?
5. Can you recode the answer without opening `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?
