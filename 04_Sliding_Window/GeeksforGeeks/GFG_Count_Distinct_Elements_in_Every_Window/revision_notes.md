# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

A sliding frequency map can update distinct count as values enter and leave.

## State or invariant to remember

frequency stores counts only for the current window.

## Optimal approach

**Sliding hashmap with zero-count erasure**

- Time: `O(n) average`
- Extra space: `O(k)`

## Mental checklist

1. What information must be maintained while moving through the array?
2. Why is the brute-force method slower?
3. Which assumption makes the optimal movement valid?
4. Which boundary, duplicate, overflow, or empty-input case can break the code?
5. Can the solution be recoded without viewing `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?

## Memory trigger

```text
Pattern: Sliding Window
Maintain: frequency stores counts only for the current window.
```
