# Revision Notes

## One-line trigger

Matching positions from the two ends must exchange values.

## State or invariant to remember

Everything outside left and right is already in its final reversed position.

## Optimal approach

**Two-pointer in-place reversal**

- Time: `O(n)`
- Extra space: `O(1)`

## Mental checklist

1. What information must be maintained while moving through the array?
2. Why is the brute-force method slower?
3. Which assumption makes the optimal movement valid?
4. Which boundary, duplicate, overflow, or empty-input case can break the code?
5. Can the solution be recoded without viewing `04_optimal_solution.cpp`?

## Memory trigger

```text
Pattern: Linear Traversal and In-Place Manipulation
Maintain: Everything outside left and right is already in its final reversed position.
```
