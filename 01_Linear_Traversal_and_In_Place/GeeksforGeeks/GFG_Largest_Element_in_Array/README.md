## Problem summary

Return the largest value present in the array.

This is a study summary, not a verbatim copy of the platform statement. Confirm the current platform signature and constraints before submission.

## Classification

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Platform | GeeksforGeeks |
| Problem number | — |
| Study difficulty | Easy |
| Main topic | Arrays / Vectors |
| Pattern | Linear Traversal and In-Place Manipulation |

## Recognition cue

The question asks for one best value after visiting every element.

## Invariant

largest stores the greatest value seen from index 0 through the current index.

## Approach progression

| Level | Approach | Time | Extra space |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Original | Your untouched first attempt | Not assessed until added | Not assessed |
| Brute force | Compare every candidate | O(n^2) | O(1) |
| Better | Sort and take the last value | O(n log n) | O(log n) |
| Optimal | Single linear scan | O(n) | O(1) |
